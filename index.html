        <h1>Marte Sta. Ana</h1>
        <div class="bio">
            <p>Hello there! I am Marte Alejandro B. Sta. Ana, a current student at the Technological Institute of the Philippines. I am a new transferee student this current semester with the aim of taking up a brand new direction in my life in pursuing the IT program. Before my transfer, I was a student at DLSU Manila for 6 years. I pursued at an Electronics Engineering degree in that institution and had a breadth of experiences in my time there. From the top notch facilities, to the diverse amount personalities I had as my classmates, along with the many activities being held, the experience was certainly a bustling school life. However, I also had a number of struggles like the long commute, the busy schedules, and the pandemic which led to very heavy loss of motivation of working towards that degree. I had the difficult decision choosing not to continue my studies in DLSU despite being eligible to shift towards other programs. </p>
            <p>It was my father who recommended that I enroll in TIP. Being an engineer and also a member of the Institute of Integrated Electrical Engineers of the Philippines (IIEE), he noted that the graduates he met from the school were excellent colleagues and were well regarded among employers. It was certainly an intriguing suggestion, so I researched more about the school and visited their campus to learn more. Suffice to say, I was very much pleased with what I learned upon visiting the campus. From the accreditations that the school has received, to the high-quality facilities of the TechnoCore building, I had a strong feeling that this was going to be the next step in my self-actualization and future career. I am eager and anticipate for the many new experience that TIP holds for me.</p>
